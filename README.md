# Creating a Web Portfolio Using Semantic HTML and Advanced CSS Methods

In this project, I created a web portfolio using semantic HTML, advanced CSS methods, and jQuery. Semantic HTML is important because it makes the code more readable, accessible, and SEO friendly. Advanced CSS methods allow for more control and creativity in the design process. jQuery allows for dynamic and interactive web elements.

## Semantic HTML

To create a semantic HTML structure, I used tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>`. These tags provide more meaning to the content of the website and make it easier for search engines to understand.

## Advanced CSS

To create an appealing and functional web portfolio, I used advanced CSS methods such as flexbox, transitions, and animations. These methods allowed me to create a responsive and visually appealing layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## jQuery

To incorporate dynamic and interactive elements, I used jQuery. This allowed me to add functionality like dropdown previews on links.

## Conclusion

By using semantic HTML and advanced CSS methods, I was able to create a web portfolio that is both functional and visually appealing. The use of semantic HTML makes the website more accessible and SEO friendly, while advanced CSS methods provide more control and creativity in the design process.
